      question: "What is database denormalization and when should it be used?",
      answer: "Denormalization adds redundant data to improve read performance. It should be used when read operations significantly outnumber write operations and when query performance is critical.",

      question: "What is the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index?",
      answer: "A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table, while a non-clustered index is a separate structure that points to the data. A table can have only one clustered index but multiple non-clustered indexes.",
      topics: ["indexing", "performance", "database-design"]

      question: "What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric key exchange?",
      answer: "Symmetric key exchange uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric key exchange uses a public-private key pair. Asymmetric is more secure but slower, often used to establish symmetric keys.",
